# Machine learning techniques for presumed PDF models in combustion

This project examines different machine learning techniques for the
modeling of mixture fraction and progress variable joint probability
density functions.

## Python environment and notebook

1. Install the python environment:
```{bash}
$ pipenv install
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook, `workflow.ipynb`
